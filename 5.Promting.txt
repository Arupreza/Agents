TUTORIAL: ZERO-SHOT, FEW-SHOT, CoT, AND ReAct PROMPTING (NO FINE-TUNING)
Goal: Write prompts that reliably produce high-quality outputs.

====================================================================

1. ZERO-SHOT PROMPTING
   ====================================================================
   Definition:
   Give the task with clear instructions and no examples.

S.P.E.C. structure:
S (Role): Who the model should be
P (Task): What to do (Analyze/Summarize/Extract/etc.)
E (Constraints): Format/length/style rules
C (Goal): What “good” looks like (audience + purpose)

Zero-shot template:
Role: [Act as …]
Task: [Do …]
Constraints: [Must …]
Goal: [Output ready for …]
Input:

###

[Your text/data]

###

Output:

Example:
Act as a Cybersecurity Expert.
Summarize the text for non-technical stakeholders.
Constraints: 5 bullets max; focus on security impact only.
Goal: Executive briefing ready.

====================================================================
2) FEW-SHOT PROMPTING
=====================

Definition:
Teach the pattern by showing a few examples (usually 3–5), then give the real input.

Few-shot template:
Instruction: [What to do + required format]

Example 1
Input: …
Output: …

Example 2
Input: …
Output: …

Target
Input: …
Output:

Tip:
Keep labels and formatting identical across all examples.

====================================================================
3) CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT (CoT)
=========================

Definition:
Encourage step-by-step reasoning for multi-step problems.

Simple trigger line:
“Let’s think step by step.”

When to use:

* Math, logic, multi-constraint decisions

When to avoid:

* Simple summarization, extraction, formatting (wastes tokens)

Optional safer constraint (keeps it short):
“Show only key steps (3–5 bullets), then the final answer.”

====================================================================
4) ReAct PROMPTING (REASON + ACT)
=================================

Definition:
Use reasoning plus actions (e.g., search/tools) to solve tasks that need information gathering.

Core loop:
Reason → Act → Observe → Reason → Final

Minimal ReAct prompt (tool-agnostic):
You are an agent that solves tasks by reasoning and taking actions when needed.
If information is missing, choose an action to obtain it.
Use the observation to continue.
Only give the final answer when you have enough information.

ReAct format template:
Task: [Your task]
Tools available: [List tools or say “none”]
Rules:

* If you need external info, take an action.
* After each action, use the observation.
* End with Final Answer.

Format:
Reason: [brief]
Action: [tool_name or “none”] | Input: [tool input]
Observation: [tool result]
...
Final Answer: [final]

Example (web search style):
Task: Find the latest security advisory for Product X and summarize impacts.
Tools available: WebSearch
Format:
Reason: Need the most recent advisory.
Action: WebSearch | Input: “Product X security advisory latest”
Observation: [results]
Reason: Identify the official advisory and key CVEs.
Final Answer: [5-bullet executive summary]
